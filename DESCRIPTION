Description: NOISEtools is a collection of functions which facilitate the import, cleaning, analysis, visualization and reporting of data from environmental noise measurements. The ones I have worked with so far are the Pulsar (https://pulsarinstruments.com/news-detail/pulsar-model-30-sound-investment-for-measuring-industrial-noise/) and the Sentry (https://convergenceinstruments.com/pc/sound-level-meter-data-loggers/)
